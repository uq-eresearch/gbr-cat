<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
Global climate change is a phenomenon that is known to affect the health of coral reefs around the world. Although there have been many studies looking at the impacts the factors associated with this multivariate and multi-dimensional phenomenon on the different members of the highly diverse ecosystems the range of factors are usually limited to only a few per experiment due to time and logistical constraints. 
</p>
<p>
GBR-CAT provides a tool for the assimilation of a wide range of physical, chemical and biological factors across a range of spatial and temporal scales across the Great Barrier Reef. This web-based tool also allows innovative analysis and mining of data and visualisation of multiple data sets aiding the identification of previously undetected interactions, patterns and synergies, and temporal trends which may be useful for the prediction of mortality events such as coral bleaching and disease outbreaks and other changes in the reef environment. 
</p>
<p>
Data can be uploading in to the GBR-CAT for analysis and visualisation, as well as for comparison with other datasets held within the data store. The ability to easily compare multiple data sets may help to highlight trends which might otherwise be missed if the results of s a study are treated independently. A range of data types can be handled including long-term remote sensor data such as temperature and light, observational, biological, ecological, chemical and satellite data.
